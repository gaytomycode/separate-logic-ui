# Bloc pattern inspired react/redux/query archicture

![Meme of Bart Simpson](bart.png)

Creating a frontend architecture that takes inspiration from Bloc pattern using React, Redux and Query. This architecture aims to isolate the business logic from the presentation layer, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between the two. By doing so, the business logic becomes highly reusable and can be easily shared across the application.

One of the key benefits of this approach is that the business logic can be moved into its own library, making it compatible with both React and React Native applications. This means that developers can implement the same business logic in both web and mobile applications, while only needing to create UI components specific to each platform.

This architecture promotes clean, maintainable code and allows for greater flexibility when developing frontend applications. By following this design pattern, developers can efficiently build and scale their applications while minimizing code duplication and maximizing code reusability.
